Test 1:
The Value of Coefficients: 1a, -3b, 2c
So The Discriminant is Positive 1
The Roots are Real and Different
Root 1: 2
Root 2: 1

Test 2:
The Value of Coefficients: 1a, -2b, 1c
So The Discriminant is Zero 0
The Roots are Real and the Same
Root: 1

Test 2=3:
The Value of Coefficients: 1a, 2b, 5c
So The Discriminant is negative -16
Roots are Complex and Different
Root 1: -1 + 2i
Root 2: -1 - 2i
